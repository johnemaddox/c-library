 * Camera Common State Flags
 *
 *  Common state flags for error handling. This will need to be
 *  modified for practical purposes. The current state is useful
 *  for testing purposes. Different camera manufactures will likely
 *  have different error handling flags. These flags can be mapped
 *  to the flags added to cam_flag_t. Extra was added as a way to
 *  pass other values that may be needed for certain calls.
