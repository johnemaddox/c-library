# C Library

This is a collection of C code that I frequently use in projects.

## Build Commands

- **./build test \[name]:** Compiles with debug flags and runs test. The test name is the directory name of the source.
- **./build debug:** Compiles with debug flags.
- **./build clean:** Removes ./out (build) directory.

## VScode

When prompted, type the name of the test you wish to run or debug, the test name is the same as the directory name of the library item.

## External Libraries

- gtest

## Ubuntu Packages

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential gdb cmake
```
